# üöÄ Spring Boot Beginner Projects

This repository contains **3 beginner-friendly Spring Boot projects** I built to learn and practice real-world backend concepts like REST APIs, database integration, authentication, WebSockets, GraphQL, and caching.

I made these projects for **anyone who wants to learn good project structure and clean code practices** with Spring Boot.  
Each project is simple but demonstrates **important building blocks** for backend development.
